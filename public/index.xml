      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The First Amendment to the United States Constitution is often hailed as the bedrock of American democracy, guaranteeing the cherished right to free speech. For centuries, this right has served as a shield for individuals to express their beliefs, challenge authority, and participate in public discourse. Yet, as society moves deeper into the digital era, the question of what constitutes free speech—and how far its protections extend—has become increasingly complex. Social media platforms, which now serve as the primary forums for public dialogue, present a paradox: they amplify voices but also, in their role as private companies, regulate and restrict speech. This article will explore the intersection of the First Amendment and social media, the challenges of modern speech regulation, and how courts and lawmakers are grappling with these new realities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
